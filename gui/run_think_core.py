Test Surrogate for ThinkCore Process.

This script simulates the output of the main 'think_core' process. It is used
for testing and demonstrating the capabilities of the LogDisplay GUI without
needing to run the actual, potentially complex, backend process.

It generates a variety of log messages at different levels and formats,
including hyperlink detection, spinner animations, and progress bars.
